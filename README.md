# Endpoint Security System Project

Basic Idea: Learn low-level programming using C/C++ and
 use it along with ML to build a Endpoint Security System that
 can detect threats like malware and viruses before they cause damage.
 
 
First Step: Make ML model that can detect Malware/Virus based on certain features
OR: Figure out how to detect using known signatures 

Then build C++ program that takes file/folder of files as input, scan each file,
and if something is detected, create a report using an LLM.
